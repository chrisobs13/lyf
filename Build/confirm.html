		<h4>who</h4>
		<p>
			Inspired by the incredible New England yoga community and the stunning natural environment Cape Cod offers, four local yogis came together to dream up a yoga festival that celebrates both.  Former yoga studio owner Annika Iliadis, eco-boutique owner Amanda Converse, artist and gallery owner Jen Villa, and communications consultant Kate Sheehan are excited to share Love Yoga Fest with kindred spirits from near and far.
