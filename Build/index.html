				<h4>what</h4>
				<p>
					The Love Yoga Festival is a celebration of all things yoga and wellness for yogis of all levels.  The fest will feature a fun welcome evening followed by two full days of yoga, body and energy work, and unique experiences  &hellip; plus, we have exciting surprises to reveal in the coming weeks!  We are thrilled to be bringing you some well-known names in the yoga community as well as favorite instructors from throughout New England, including Cape Cod.

				<h4>who</h4>
				<p>
					Inspired by the incredible New England yoga community and the stunning natural environment Cape Cod offers, four local yogis came together to dream up a yoga festival that celebrates both.  Former yoga studio owner Annika Iliadis, eco-boutique owner Amanda Converse, artist and gallery owner Jen Villa, and communications consultant Kate Sheehan are excited to share Love Yoga Fest with kindred spirits from near and far.
